Make a CLI tool that allows you to send any Token to any address on the Solana blockchain.
The tool should support the following features:
- Send any SPL Token to any address
- Support for both mainnet and devnet
- Allow users to specify the amount of tokens to send
- Allow users to specify the token mint address
- Allow users to specify the recipient address
- Provide feedback on the transaction status

- Handle errors gracefully
- Use the Solana Web3.js library for blockchain interactions
- Include a help command to display usage instructions
- Ensure the tool is secure and does not expose private keys
- Include unit tests for the main functionalities
- Document the code and provide a README with instructions on how to install and use the tool
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
